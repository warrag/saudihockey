3) If you want to print the file, for better results I suggest setting the Excel sheet to Landscape format first. In LibreOffice Calc this can be done be going to "Format" menu -> Page, then opening the "Page" tab in the window that appears.

4) You can also download of buy some Odoo module that directly converts a pivot view to PDF.
